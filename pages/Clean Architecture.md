	- Bad architecture
		- complex
		- incoherent
		- Rigid
		- Brittle
		- Untestable
		- Unmaintainable
	- Good Arquitecture
	- simple

- What is Clean Architecture
	- > Architecture that is designed for the inhabitants of the architecture... not for the architect... or the machine
- Why ivest in clean architecture?
	- cost/benefit
	- minimize cost
	- maximize value
	- maximize ROI
	- focus o the essential
	- build onliy what is necessary
	- optimize for maintainability
